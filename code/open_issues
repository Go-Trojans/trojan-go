BLOCKER
	1.
	
	
	[OLD]
	Puranjay : commit the code for Tromp Troy winner function as well as winner function as per Chinese rule. [Closed]
	Raveena and Puranjay: Overall Tau functionality as we discussed and do some UT to see it is working as expected. 
	   (Check the current code and then decide) [Closed: TAU = 0.1 after fixed moves]
 


IMP

	1. [Haoming] GTP [Saturday timeline. David]
	2. As of now during MCTS and Evaluation, we are using CPU only for nn.prediction. Can we use GPU to do the same.
	
	   [Raveena] to verify !!!
	   Check this if by default it is not working: https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/gpu#manual_device_placement
	   
	3. [David] to understand Gaussian Process Optimization for MCTS (decide on #simulations, when to set "TAU" 1 & 0, Dirichlet Coeff, Epsilon and other MCTS Hyper-Params).
	4. [Rupesh and David] If possible implement the checkpointing model; as of now code is commented in MCTSSelfplay.train() because of minor issue. 

        [OLD]
	1. Dirichlet Noise is used during self-play only or it is used during Actual Game play as well ? [How it is used in AlphaGo Zero]
	   (As of now it is getting used in self-play as well as actual game). 
	   Findings: Dirichlet Noise should be used during self-lay only. [Resolved]
	2. Using "TAU" during the Actual Game Play or during Evaluation. (As of now it doesn't have this support) [Closed]


TESTING
	1. Commit the code for EarlyStopping [Needs to be Tested]
	2. Commit the code for tf.distribute.Strategy while training the model. [Needs to be Tested]
	3. GPU tensorflow memory issues, check these functions ...
		- check for any tensorflow sessions
		- utils.system_info()
		- utils.set_gpu_memory_target() used from different child processes.
		- during play, MCTSSelfplay.play(): nn.predict is using tensorflow model
		- during training, MCTSSelfplay.train(), tf.distribute.Strategy()
	
	
Optimization
	1. Self-play and MCTS parallelisation using virtual loss.
	2. Trying to use TrojanGo Pipeline.
	3.
	

Run
	1. Puranjay to run on his server and update the result.[July 18th is the timeline as server is not available before then]
	2. Rupesh to tey the code running on server and update the result.
	3. Raveena to run oon her laptop and see the usage of GPU (mainly for model.predict)
