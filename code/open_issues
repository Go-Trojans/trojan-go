BLOCKER
	1. Puranjay : commit the code for Tromp Troy winner function as well as winner function as per Chinese rule. [Closed]
	2. Raveena and Puranjay: Overall Tau functionality as we discussed and do some UT to see it is working as expected. 
	   (Check the current code and then decide)
	3. 


IMP
	1. Dirichlet Noise is used during self-play only or it is used during Actual Game play as well ? [How it is used in AlphaGo Zero]
	   (As of now it is getting used in self-play as well as actual game). [Resolved]
	2. Using "TAU" during the Actual Game Play or during Evaluation. (As of now it doesn't have this support) [Closed]
	
	3. GTP (Haoming) [Saturday timeline. David]
	4. Commit the code for EarlyStopping [Needs to be Tested]
	5. Commit the code for tf.distribute.Strategy while training the model. [Needs to be Tested]
	6. As of now during MCTS and Evaluation, we are using CPU only for nn.prediction. Can we use GPU to do the same.
	7. David to understand Gaussian Process Optimization for MCTS.

Optimization
	1. Self-play and MCTS parallelisation using virtual loss.
	2. Trying to use TrojanGo Pipeline.
	3.
	

Run
	1. Puranjay to run on his server and update the result.[July 18th is the timeline as server is not available before then]
	2. Rupesh to tey the code running on server and update the result.
	3. Raveena to run oon her laptop and see the usage of GPU (mainly for model.predict)
